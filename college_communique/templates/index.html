                            As the winter winds mellow and the sun's journey shifts, India welcomes Makar Sankranti, a festival that symbolizes the transition of seasons, gratitude for the harvest, and the beginning of brighter days. Celebrated nationwide with unique traditions, Makar Sankranti carries a universal message of harmony, unity, and renewal.One of the most endearing customs associated with Makar Sankranti is the preparation and sharing of til-gul laddoos, made from sesame seeds (til) and jaggery (gul). This tradition holds deep cultural and emotional value. The Marathi saying, "Til-gul ghya, ani goad-goad bola" translates to “Take these sweets and speak sweetly,” encouraging kindness, positivity, and reconciliation.</p>
